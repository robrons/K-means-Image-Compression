# K-means-Image-Compression
### Purpose
* To deeply understand the implementation's of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 
* To represent an imagee in a more efficent way through reduction of color channels.
### Concepts
* The color cout of the imge will be reduced to 16. 
* The k means algorithm will be run on smaller image size  due to computational restriction and then use the 16 colots to replacethe pixels in the larger image.  
### Results
* **Image before Compression (Size: 592.8 KB)**
